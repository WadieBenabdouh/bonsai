  > Line 338 : Footer links sometimes could look weird if there's so many links, I invented this method to separate some links from others, by adding this:

                        <li>Privacy Policy</li>
                        <li>Legal</li>
                        <!-- space here -->
this                    <li style="margin-top:20px;">Affiliates</li>
                        <li>Write for Us</li>
                        <!-- space here -->
this                    <li style="margin-top:20px;">Comparisons</li>
